This is a detailed guide on how to create useful debug logs for the Firewire driver.

To create log files using the debug version of the Firewire drivers you need the 
following equipment:
- two computers
  - one of them with the Firewire controller installed (called Firewire system from now)
  - the other one to capture the messages  (called capture system from now)
- both computers should have at least one COM port each
- one null modem cable for the COM port

The following software is required:
- OS/2 debug kernel and loader
  - a debug kernel and loader can be found on the eCS and Warp 4 CDs
  - os2image\debug   or   os2image\debug\smp   or   os2image\debug\uni
  - the file readme.dbg explains how to use the kernels
- a terminal program
  - basically any terminal program will work
  - make sure the terminal program can log sessions to a file
  - for example: ZOC 
  - seach for "ZOC" at http://hobbes.nmsu.edu

In addition, you should have knowledge about changing the OS/2 kernel. This 
document does not describe how to change an OS/2 release kernel against a debug 
kernel and loader.

The setup:
==========
First of all, you should change the Firewire system to use the debug kernel. 
Do NOT install the Firewire drivers yet! After you have installed the debug kernel, 
reboot the system to make sure it works normally.
Now connect the two computers with the null modem cable. If the Firewire system 
has two COM ports, connect the null modem cable to COM 2. (even if COM 1 is empty!) 
The COM port on the capture system is not important, just make sure you know what 
COM port it is.
The next step is to install your terminal program. After you have it installed, 
make sure it listens to the COM port with the null modem cable and set it to 
8,N,1. Make sure the connection speed is set to 9600 baud!
(For ZOC, simply press the Cancel button when ZOC starts)

Testing the connection:
=======================
Make sure the null modem cable is connected and the terminal program is started 
at the capture system and then reboot the Firewire system. (Make sure the Firewire 
drivers are NOT installed!) When looking at the terminal program you should see some 
messages that the debug kernel outputs. They should begin with:
System Debugger 8/8/97 [686]

If you are not seeing those messages, you need to check your setup! If 
you see those messages, continue.

Install the Firewire drivers:
=============================
Now install the debug Firewire drivers by copying 6 files to your boot drive 
into the OS2\BOOT directory:
fired.sys and fired.sym
firemgr.sys and firemgr.sym
firehci.sys and firehci.sym

Add the following three lines to config.sys:
Basedev=fired.sys
Basedev=firemgr.sys
Basedev=firehci.sys

Now shutdown the Firewire system.

Capturing the debug messages:
=============================
If you are using ZOC, close ZOC now and go to the logs directory of ZOC and 
delete all logs. Now restart ZOC. This makes sure that you are using a new log 
file for the Firewire debug messages. If you are using another terminal program, 
simply make sure you are starting a new log file.

Make sure there is nothing connected to the Firewire controller!

Make sure the terminal program is running and start the Firewire system.

You will see a few messages in the terminal program. Finally a line will appear 
that starts like this:
##
Followed by a blinking cursor. This means that the first Firewire driver has 
started to load and that it is waiting in a breakpoint. Press "g" followed by 
enter (in the terminal program!). You have to do this a couple of times until:
1. The WPS has loaded.
2. The terminal program shows a TRAP message.
3. The Firewire system just hangs...

If the WPS has loaded shut down the Firewire system. You will also have to press "g" 
followed by enter a couple of times until the system has shut down.
If you are seeing a TRAP in the terminal window or the Firewire system just hangs, power 
off the Firewire system.

Now close the terminal program and go to the log directory. Take 
the newly created log file and rename it to:
<yourName>_ControllerOnly_<date>_<time>.log

If you have a Firewire device you are kindly asked to repeat the steps above 
with the device attached. Name the new log:
<yourName>_WithDevice_<date>_<time>.log

Sending the logs:
=================

Now mail the logs to:
doctor64@dochome.homedns.org

It would be good if you provide some information in the eMail about what you 
have tested and with what Firewire devices.


Thats it!
Thanks a lot!
